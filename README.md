# ETHSingapore hack: sharding!

Sharding built on top of my experimental project [`protolith`](https://github.com/protolambda/protolith).


    // TODO more docs



## Contributing

Discussions/suggestions are always welcome, but this code is just me during the hackathon.
This repo will be made public near the end of the hackathon,
 PRs/issues will be open after judging, to grow the project :)
